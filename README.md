# 🚀 Python Task Solver

A **super simple** and **efficient Python script** that automatically solves **mathematical expressions** from text files. Just drop a file with expressions into the `tasks here` folder, and watch the script solve them for you in real-time. 🎉

## Key Features:
- **Fast and easy setup** — no extra libraries required! ⚡
- **Supports multiple mathematical operations**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` (exponentiation), and more! 🔢
- **Real-time file monitoring** — check your folder every second for new tasks. 🕐
- **Handles both integer and decimal numbers**. 🔄

## Usage:
1. **Drop your `.txt` file** containing math expressions into the `tasks here` folder.
2. Run the script, and it will **automatically solve** each expression inside the file. 📄
3. Watch the results printed directly in your terminal/PowerShell. 📊

### Example:

Create a file like `example1.txt` and add some math expressions:
2 * 3
5 + 1.5
10 / 2
7 ** 2

After running the script, the output will look like this:
📄 Processing file: example1.txt
[1] 2 * 3 = 6
[2] 5 + 1.5 = 6.5
[3] 10 / 2 = 5.0
[4] 7 ** 2 = 49


## Installation:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Run the script directly with `python script.py`.

Perfect for learning, experimenting with Python, or just automating your math tasks in a fun way! 🎮
